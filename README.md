Inventory DB.

A database management application to keep track of laptops on hand. How many laptops of certian models, like HP, Lenovo, Dell.
How many are working, not working.
Which laptops are assigned to users.
Search by serial or enter a partial serial number.
Search by Model.
List all models on hand.
List all serial numbers of laptops on hand that are un-assigned to a user.
Kept track of shipments to Oregon, USA. These were laptops that were sent using a shipment memo and FedEx tracking number.
The shipment memo also listed the serials of the laptops, and can easily search for the serial in the memos DB.
The application uses CSS, HTML as the front end, and little of javascript.
The backend uses Java, JSP/Servlets and the MVC model.
Eclipse was used as the IDE to code.
The database used is the free open source MySQL.
And, Tomcat version 9 used as the web server for the Java app.

The app allows for a user to login to make any changes, like adding a laptop, modifying, deleting.
The app also keeps track of laptops shipped out to the IT center in America for repairs or for legal purposes or simply by request from the IT operations.

Lessons Learned

Had to learn about Eclipse, setting up Tomcat server in Eclipse. And, how to use the MVC model within JSP/Servlets.
How to handle requests, and send info from the customer to the server and process the requests.
Database design was also the stumbling block, and had to learn (re-learn) database designs and database modelling.

---------------------------------------------

Outcome/Results

Keeping track of laptops on hand meant 100% in inventory, no loss in inventory, and maintaining good accurate accounting of inventory.
This made the company Intel happy, as every month an audit takes place to make sure laptops on hand matches the central database server.
